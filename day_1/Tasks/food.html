A staple dish is Nasi Goreng, a flavorful fried rice often served with egg, chicken, or shrimp. Babi Guling, or roast pig, is another iconic Balinese dish, prepared with traditional spices and served during special ceremonies. Satay skewers, made from marinated meat and served with peanut sauce, are a popular street food. Fresh seafood, tropical fruits, and aromatic herbs like lemongrass and turmeric also play a major role in Balinese cooking.";
